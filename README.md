# Purpose

A basic flask app demonstrating some of Flask's features, intended to be introduced to students who have about a semester of introductory programming, in a 60-90 minute lecture. 

# Notes

This app is obviously missing a lot of features. There are no user accounts. You can't upload a photo to make a new post. You can't like posts. None of the data is saved persistently. In the codebase, there's no error handling. The templates both have the same header. The images should be dynamic. 

You can probably think of a lot more features that this would need to be a usable app.
